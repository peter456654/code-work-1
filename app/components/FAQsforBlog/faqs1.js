    question: "What are Activity Launch Modes in Android?",
    answer: [
      "Activity Launch Modes in Android define how new instances of an activity are created and how they interact with existing ones in the back stack. The four main modes are: Standard, SingleTop, SingleTask, and SingleInstance.",
    ],
  },
  {
    question: "What is the default launch mode for activities in Android?",
    answer: [
      "The default launch mode is Standard. In this mode, every time an activity is launched, a new instance is created and added to the back stack, regardless of whether an instance already exists.",
    ],
  },
  {
    question: "When should I use SingleTop launch mode?",
    answer: [
      "Use SingleTop when you want to reuse the current activity if it's already at the top of the stack. This avoids creating a new instance and instead triggers the onNewIntent() method.",
    ],
  },
  {
    question: "How does SingleTask launch mode work?",
    answer: [
      "In SingleTask mode, if an activity is already running in a task, a new instance is not created. Instead, it brings the existing instance to the foreground and clears all activities above it in the stack.",
    ],
  },
  {
    question: "What is the key difference between SingleTask and SingleInstance?",
    answer: [
      "SingleTask: Only one instance exists within a task, but other activities can still be in the same task.",
      "SingleInstance: The activity is placed in its separate task and is the only activity in that task",
    ],
  },
  {
    question: "How does SingleInstance improve activity management?",
    answer: [
      "SingleInstance ensures only one activity per task, providing isolation and memory efficiency. It's ideal for scenarios like video players, chat windows, or login screens that should not be duplicated.",
    ],
  },
  {
    question: "What is the role of onNewIntent() in launch modes?",
    answer: [
      "The onNewIntent() method is triggered when an activity is reused instead of recreated. This occurs in SingleTop, SingleTask, and SingleInstance modes when the existing activity is brought to the foreground.",
    ],
  },
  {
    question: "Can I declare launch modes in the AndroidManifest.xml?",
    answer: [
      "Yes! You can set the launch mode using the android:launchMode attribute in your activity declaration within the AndroidManifest.xml.",
      `<activity
    android:name=".YourActivity"
    android:launchMode="singleTop"
    />`
    ],
  },
  {
    question: "Which launch mode is best for a Settings screen?",
    answer: [
      "The SingleTask mode is ideal for a Settings screen, as it ensures there's only one instance, avoids redundancy, and maintains user state efficiently.",
    ],
  },
  {
    question: "How do launch modes affect the activity lifecycle?",
    answer: [
      "Launch modes influence whether lifecycle methods like onCreate(), onStart(), or onNewIntent() are called. For example:",
      "Standard: onCreate() is always called.",
      "SingleTop: Skips onCreate() if activity is on top; calls onNewIntent().",
      "SingleTask/SingleInstance: Reuses existing instance, triggers onNewIntent() if present."
    ],
  },
